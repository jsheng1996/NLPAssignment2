# Question 2

Named Entity Recognition

---

## notebook for part i to iii

- q2_part_1to3.ipynb

note:
- can be ran / viewed using Google Colaboratory (need to upload data to Google Drive first, in 'NLPAssignment2' folder)
- corresponding model: self-trained-model-lstm

---

## notebooks for part iv and v

- q2 - 1 cnn layer - conv2.ipynb
- q2 - 1 cnn layer.ipynb

note:
- can be ran / viewed using Jupyter Notebook
  - requires PyTorch
- models have the same names as their notebooks
